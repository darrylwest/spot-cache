# To Do List

A list of Stuff that needs to be done...

* finish client implementations
* swap tcp sockets with unix sockets and benchmark to see if it beats 87ms/1000 tx
* replace fixed buffer with dynamic to read request bytes
* examine and compare socket logic to redis and mongo
* refactor to read a conf file and put in /etc/spotcache/spotcahce.conf
* create a REPL for the cache database
